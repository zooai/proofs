  Authority Meet-Semilattice

  Models authority as a set of capabilities with meet (intersection).
  Authority can only NARROW through delegation — never escalate.

  Maps to:
  - hanzo/iam: RBAC permission sets
  - lux/node: validator capability scoping
  - zoo/contracts: role-based access control

  Properties:
  - Meet is commutative, associative, idempotent
  - Authority narrows through delegation (monotone)
  - Meet is greatest lower bound
