  Cross-Ecosystem Build Verification

  Proves that verified builds compose across Hanzo, Lux, and Zoo.
  A build in one ecosystem can depend on artifacts from another,
  with attestation chains crossing ecosystem boundaries.

  Maps to:
  - hanzo/platform: deploys artifacts from all three ecosystems
  - lux/consensus: records cross-ecosystem attestations
  - zoo/contracts: consumes verified Lux node builds

  Properties:
  - Attestation chains compose across ecosystems
  - Cross-ecosystem trust requires shared roots
  - Content addressing is ecosystem-agnostic
