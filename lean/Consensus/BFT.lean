  Byzantine Fault Tolerance Threshold Proof

  Theorem: Safety and liveness hold when f < n/3 nodes are Byzantine.

  This is the structural argument that connects the BFT assumption
  to the threshold voting mechanism.

  Maps to Go code:
  - core/dag/horizon.go: Params{N, F int} where F < N/3
  - core/dag/flare.go: HasCertificate requires 2*F+1 support
  - protocol/wave/wave.go: alpha threshold derived from honest majority
  - protocol/quasar/quasar.go: BLS aggregation with 2f+1 threshold

  Core argument:
  Given n = 3f + 1 nodes (optimal), honest = n - f = 2f + 1.
  Any k-sample of size k from n nodes contains at most f Byzantine.
  So honest votes in sample >= k - f.
  If alpha = ceil(2k/3), then honest majority in sample suffices.
  Two conflicting values cannot both achieve alpha in the same sample
  because that would require 2*alpha > 2*(2k/3) = 4k/3 > k total votes.
