  Flash Loan Safety

  Atomic borrow-use-repay within a single transaction.
  If repayment fails, entire transaction reverts.

  Properties:
  - Atomicity: borrow + use + repay in one tx
  - Solvency: pool balance ≥ pre-loan balance after tx
  - Fee accrual: flash loan fee goes to LPs
  - No residual debt: loan is fully repaid or fully reverted
