  Liquid Staking and Yield Protocol

  Staked assets earn yield while remaining liquid.
  Money at rest is put to work — implicit staking of
  idle liquidity in the DEX pools.

  Maps to:
  - lux/node: validator staking (P-Chain)
  - lux/exchange: LP staking rewards
  - zoo/contracts: liquid staking derivatives

  Properties:
  - Yield accrual: staked assets earn validator rewards
  - Liquidity: staked assets remain tradeable (liquid derivatives)
  - No impermanent loss on single-sided staking
  - Compounding: rewards auto-compound into staking position
