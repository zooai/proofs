  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Top-level correctness theorem for the Lux Network.

  If this file compiles, the following hold:
  - Consensus is safe and live under BFT assumptions
  - Post-quantum crypto requires breaking all three schemes
  - Authority only narrows through delegation
  - DeFi exchange preserves constant product invariant
  - On-premise HFT captures full spread
  - Cross-chain teleport conserves assets
  - Liquid staking accrues yield monotonically
